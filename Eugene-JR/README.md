Quest Description: "Shadow of the Past"
You and your team receive a mysterious letter inviting you to an abandoned mansion on the outskirts of the city. The letter is signed by the famous historian Artem Lysenko, who mysteriously disappeared 20 years ago. In the letter, he claims to have uncovered evidence of an ancient conspiracy that could change history forever.

As you step inside the eerie mansion, the doors creak shut behind you. The air is thick with the scent of old books, and the dim candlelight barely illuminates the grand hallway. The walls whisper secrets of the past, and every room holds hidden clues, puzzles, and dangers.

Your choices will determine the outcome of the story. Will you uncover the truth, or will you fall victim to the mysteries lurking in the shadows?
